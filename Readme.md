# 🚗 AIBAS Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on key features. It was developed as part of the AIBAS coursework project.

## 📌 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a regression model that accurately estimates car prices using a clean and well-prepared dataset. This helps buyers and sellers understand fair pricing based on market trends and vehicle attributes.

## 🔍 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training using Regression Algorithms
- Model Evaluation (R², RMSE)
- Deployment-ready notebook

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the following source:
  https://github.com/MayCooper/Product-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Updated%20Project/Car%20details%20v3.xls

The dataset includes car listings with the following features:
- `model`
- `year`
- `price`
- `mileage`
- `fuelType`
- `transmission`
- `engineSize`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started
